Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The ones where N was smaller. The predictions that used N = 10 gave bigger and rounded winning percentages

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Probably N = 1000 is the best time/result efficient
